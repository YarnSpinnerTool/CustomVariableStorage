# CustomVariableStorage

An example project showing how to make a custom variable storage system for Yarn Spinner for Unity v3.
This example project exists to be the code used in a guide, for more details on how it works please see that [guide](https://docs.yarnspinner.dev/next/yarn-spinner-for-game-engines/unity/unity-samples/variable-storage).

This code uses a tweaked version of Laurent Dupuis' minimal perfect hash available under the GPL v3.
